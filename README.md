Habit tracking app (Lighthouse Labs Final Project)

In progress..

The app allows you to track habits and set goals (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly) for how frequently you want to do it. It helps you achieve these goals and form habits by displaying all your goals, and telling you how many you have left to do. It will also place “higher priority” goals nearer the top of the grid and goals/habits already done will be at the bottom.
